    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings everyone, Zhexos here.  </p>

<p>Although THE PRIMALS Live in Tokyo - Bringers of Shadow concert series was cancelled, we're pleased to announce that their latest release, Out of the Shadows, is now available! </p>

<p><span style="color:gold;font-weight:bolder">THE PRIMALS - Out of the Shadows<span></p>

<p><img src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/fr_blog/b0a69da6dbae29acb08a701c97a924977aa3b809_0.png" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" width="300" height="300"><br />
 <br />
Have you purchased your copy yet? </p>

<p>Out of the Shadows is the first CD release since THE PRIMALS debut album in 2018! Some songs are being released for the first time, so we highly recommend you give them a listen! </p>

<p>You can also purchase the digital version for download! </p>

<p>The CD is available for purchase only from the <a href="https://sqex.to/hhfsp" target="_blank">Square Enix Store</a>. <br />
The digital version is available from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B086Z4NLGS" target="_blank">Amazon Music</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/music/album?id=B5rsgcvyi3gsfaaz3m6vyocqtjy" target="_blank">Google Play Music</a>, and <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/album/the-primals-out-of-the-shadows-ep/1505481262" target="_blank">iTunes</a>.<br />
<em><font color="red">*Availability may vary per region.<br />
*Price may differ according to retailer.</font></em></p>

<p>Today, I'd like to go over the album and the four amazing songs it features! </p>

<p><img alt="20200410-yn-01.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/jp_blog/20200410-yn-01.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" width="600" height="450"></p>

<p>The first song is <font style="color:plum;font-weight:bold">Insatiable</font>, which has been arranged for the 4th anniversary of DISSIDIA FINAL FANTASY. As of Patch 5.2, you can also enjoy this song during the mid-boss battles in each of the Shadowbringers dungeons! </p>

<p>The second song is <font style="color:plum;font-weight:bold">Ultima</font>, which plays during the first half of the battle against the Ruby Weapon! The heavy echo of the guitar and chorus are outstanding in this arranged version! Apparently, they mentioned that they struggled to record this song, and by the time they left the studio it was already morning! </p>

<p><img alt="20200410-yn-02.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/jp_blog/20200410-yn-02.jpg" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" width="600" height="338"></p>

<p>The third song, <font style="color:plum;font-weight:bold">Blinding Indigo</font>, is heard when battling against Leviathan in Eden's Gate: Inundation. Just as Leviathan's appearance was changed by the Warrior of Light's imagination and memory (?), the original Leviathan's theme was transformed by the imagination and talent of Soken and THE PRIMALS! </p>

<p>The final song is Titania's theme, <font style="color:plum;font-weight:bold">What Angel Wakes Me</font>. Though the original song features an adorable triple-meter beat, this rocking remix now has a quadruple-meter! <strong>♬<font color="pink">FA</font><font color="lightgreen">LA</font><font color="pink">LA</font><font color="lightgreen">LA</font><font color="pink">LA</font><font color="lightgreen">LA</font>♬</strong>! </p>

<p>I can't imagine how they came up with this remix... you'll just have to listen to it yourself! </p>

<p>Whether you pick them up on CD or as a digital download, we hope that you'll enjoy these new songs from THE PRIMALS! </p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings, everyone!  </p>

<p>The warm and sunny season of spring is slowly rolling in across the Northern Hemisphere, and with it comes the return of our spring-themed seasonal event, <a href="https://sqex.to/PeMPL" target="_blank">Hatching-tide</a>! The event that sprouted from the dream of a young girl is about to start once more!  </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_01.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_01.jpg" width="630" height="354" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><font color="#85fd93" style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;">Seasonal Event Schedule</font><br />
This time, the Hatching-tide seasonal event is separated into two chapters. </p>

<p><span style="padding-left:10px;"><font color="#85fd93" style="font-weight:bold;">Chapter 1</font></span><br />
<span style="padding-left:10px;">From Monday, 30 March, 2020 at 8:00 to Sunday, 5 April, 2020 at 14:59 (GMT)</span></p>

<p><span style="padding-left:10px;"><font color="#85fd93" style="font-weight:bold;">Chapter 2</font></span><br />
<span style="padding-left:10px;">From Sunday, 5 April, 2020 at 15:00 to Monday, 13 April, 2020 at 14:59 (GMT)</span></p>

<p><font color="#85fd93" style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;">How to Participate</font> <br />
Start by cracking down on this year's egg-citing quest, "the Eggth Umbral Calamity," by speaking to the revelrous rabbit in Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre. </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_02.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_02.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>In Chapter 1, adventurers are asked to hop on the case of a chicken on the loose. </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_03.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_03.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>We hope all of you will scramble and capture the Hatching-tide's most wanted--the hard-boiled chicken! </p>

<p>In Chapter 2, with the preparations complete, the seasonal event is ready. I wonder what's going to hoppen this time around.  </p>

<p>"What if I missed chapter 1?" you may be thinking. Even if chapter 2 is underway, you'll still be able to capture the chicken from chapter 1, so worry not!  </p>

<p><font color="#85fd93" style="font-size:large;font-weight:bold;">Quest Reward</font><br />
Adventurers will be rewarded with the rabbit head and suit attire (both of which are dyeable).  </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_04.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_04.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Look at those fluffy hands and feet!   </p>

<p>For indoor furnishings, we have the stuffed rabbit (also dyeable) and the Hatching-tide advertisement featuring artwork from the 2018 event. </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_05.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_05.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>That's not all! Once chapter 2 commences, you'll be able to purchase the dapper rabbit suit, which is a rabbit suit adorned with a ribbon! And yes, this is dyeable too! </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_06.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_06.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200327_07.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/EN_20200327_07.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>We have a few more days until the event begins, and I hope everyone is egg-cited as much as we are!  </p>

<p>That's all, yolks!  </p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Hi everyone, </p>

<p>Can you believe it's already been a month since Patch 5.2 launched? Time really does fly! </p>

<p>Between the new Eden raid, ocean fishing, and Ishgardian Restoration there's much to experience! Throughout your journeys, do you ever stop and take a moment to get lost in the music?</p>

<p>The latest installment of the Eden raid series introduced a lot of surprises and "familiar" foes! Primals like Ramuh and Shiva were not the only things re-imagined throughout the raid series though, as players were pleasantly surprised to hear re-imagined tracks by Soken himself! There's one song in particular that gives me chills every time I hear it. I'm sure you know which I'm referring to!</p>

<p>Without further ado, let's take a look at the lyrics for <em>Return to Oblivion</em>!</p>

<p><img alt="JP20200323_sn_01.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/JP20200323_sn_01.png" width="630" height="303" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><span style="color:#00000;">=======================</span><br />
<span style="color:blue;font-style:italic;"><strong><font size="5">Return to Oblivion</font></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Wanting, I lie<br />
Too weary to die<br />
Too lost to the ice for saving<br />
My sins claim me, untame me</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Eyes wet with tears<br />
Her song in my ears<br />
Broken, faded, how long have I waited<br />
To open my wings?</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Turn the light on<br />
And let her in. Won't you<br />
Turn the light on<br />
Turn the light on<br />
You'll never win 'less you<br />
Turn the light on<br />
Turn the light on<br />
The pain won't end 'till you<br />
Turn the light on<br />
The soul longs for oblivion, oblivion</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Falling too far for the fear to embrace me<br />
A voice from the past screaming there is no end (no)<br />
A slave to my fate, ever doomed to repeat this<br />
again and again and again and again (yeah, I'm)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Falling too fast, no it won't overtake me<br />
A voice from the past echoes loud like a drum (oh, yes)<br />
no more goodbyes, though my heart is still aching<br />
Now open my eyes, one more time, Here I come</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Reason resigned<br />
Dark seasons' design<br />
Spring's promise of sun is honored<br />
When winter's weighed down on us</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Visions in white<br />
Raw fury in flight<br />
Clear as diamond, yet fragile as ice<br />
My heart is racing</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Turn the light on<br />
And let her in. Won't you<br />
Turn the light on<br />
Turn the light on<br />
You'll never win 'less you<br />
Turn the light on<br />
Turn the light on<br />
The pain won't end 'till you<br />
Turn the light on<br />
The soul longs for oblivion, oblivion</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Falling too far for the fear to embrace me<br />
A voice from the past screaming there is no end (no)<br />
A slave to my fate, ever doomed to repeat this<br />
again and again and again and again (yeah, I'm)</span></p>

<p><span style="color:skyblue;">Falling too fast, but the fall will not break me<br />
A voice from the past echoes loud like a drum (oh, yes)<br />
no more goodbyes, I am tired of waiting<br />
Now open my eyes, one last time, Here I come (yeah I come) </span></p>

<p><span style="color:#00000;">=======================</span></p>

<p>There's so much raw emotion in the words!</p>

<p>This song is also available to purchase on the recently released <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/df107c6847df06b0a39b22720e063be85b05592c">Shadowbringers EP</a>!</p>

<p>Next time you journey into Refulgence, you can sing along and get even more hyped to prevail!</p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings, everyone!</p>

<p>Bayohne here, back at the office after four days of PAX East! We had a blast seeing the community and interacting with everyone that came by! </p>

<p>Don't worry if you weren't able to visit, because today we'll be exploring the various festivities we had on tap. </p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>FINAL FANTASY XIV Booth</strong></font><br />
This year we had our own booth to contain all the excitement we had to showcase! The booth was packed with multiple things for attendees to do - grab some exciting giveaway items, challenge the Ruby Weapon Battle challenge, or try the New Player Experience, or participate in a photo opportunity featuring Shadowbringers weapon props (and our special guest Namazu)! </p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_1.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_1.png" width="650" height="419" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Let's take a closer look at each of the activities.</p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Fun Giveaways for Attendees</strong></font><br />
This year, we gave away some warm FFXIV-themed scarves as it was still quite cold in Boston during the event! These went quickly each time they appeared during the show, but it was great to see so many people keeping warm! In addition, we gave away double-sided posters featuring the job artwork by Mogi. We also had the FFXIV-themed lanyards available for all PAX East attendees!</p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_2.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_2.png" width="650" height="421" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_3b.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_3b.png" width="650" height="420" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_4.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_4.png" width="650" height="419" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Photo Op with Shadowbringers Props (and Namazu!)</strong></font><br />
This year we had an expansive backdrop featuring the Crystarium aetheryte where attendees could snap a photo with our three Shadowbringers weapon props: the Shadowbringer great sword, the Lion Heart gunblade, and Y'sthola's staff, Nightseeker.</p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_5.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_5.png" width="650" height="420" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_6.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_6.png" width="650" height="421" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_7.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_7.png" width="650" height="420" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>But that's not all! Throughout the show, a friendly Namazu would come by and visit the photo area as well (including sporting several different outfit changes).</p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_23.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_23.png" width="650" height="739" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_8.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_8.png" width="650" height="419" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_9.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_9.png" width="650" height="419" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>The Ruby Weapon Battle Challenge</strong></font><br />
The ever-popular battle challenge series continued at PAX East with the Ruby Weapon making its terrifying debut! Attendees were quick to line up and challenge the fearsome foe. Veterans and newcomers alike (with some strong guidance from staff) were able to defeat the fearsome foe and earn their rewards!</p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_10.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_10.png" width="650" height="422" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_11.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_11.png" width="650" height="421" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_12.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_12.png" width="650" height="421" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_13.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_13.png" width="650" height="419" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_14.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_14.png" width="650" height="1005" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>New Player Experience</strong></font><br />
The new player experience area was back, expanded and more packed than ever! Potential new players could queue up, get a brief demo on the jobs and combat system and test their strength against Ifrit in the main scenario story mode. Winners would then receive a free copy of the FFXIV Starter Edition for PC! We hope to see you all in Eorzea soon!</p>

<p><img alt="PAXEast2020_XIV_15.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/PAXEast2020_XIV_15.png" width="650" height="418" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><br />
<font color="#FF00FF"><strong>The Art of FFXIV Live Stream</strong></font><br />
Originally planned as a panel for PAX East, after we made some adjustments to our plans, we instead reconfigured the content as a live stream from the SE Japan audiences so that fans could still experience the content. Naoki Yoshida and Yusuke Mogi were joined by members of the localization team and held a nearly three-hour long stream showcasing the work that goes into creating the artwork of FFXIV by lead character concept artist Yusuke Mogi! </p>

<p>If you couldn't watch it live, you should check out the <a href="https://sqex.to/J78Pb" target="_blank">archived video on our Twitch channel</a>!</p>

<p><font color="#FF00FF"><strong>Amazing Cosplay</strong></font><br />
Each event we attend, we're always floored by the amazing effort that players put into their cosplay outfits. Here are a few of the costumes we were able to grab pictures of during the show!</p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings, adventurers! I'm sure everyone is busy enjoying all that Patch 5.2 has to offer right now. Perhaps you're sailing out on the Endeavor, catching up with the Qitari, or battling familiar foes in Eden's Verse! </p>

<p>I hope you are having fun no matter the activity, but I wanted to take a moment to preview one of FFXIV's signature seasonal events for you, <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/2020/Little_Ladies_Day/">Little Ladies' Day</a>!</p>

<p><img alt="01.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/01.jpg" width="630" height="354" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Event Period</span></strong> 　　<br />
Monday, 2 March, 2020 at 8:00 (GMT) to Monday, 16 March, 2020 at 14:59 (GMT)</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">How To Participate</span></strong><br />
Head over to Ul'dah - Steps of Nald.（X:10.5 Y:18.6. The royal seneschal will be waiting for your aid!</p>

<p><img alt="02.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/02.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Reward Items</span></strong><br />
This year, you'll be able to walk away in style! The dev. team created head accessories for little ladies and seneschals alike. There are also themed housing items to get your place ready for the festivities!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:pink">Headgear - "Princess's Peach Corsage"</span></strong></p>

<p><img alt="03.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/03.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><br />
Isn't this hair corsage just lovely? ✿ <br />
Best of all, it is dyeable, so you can change the flowers color to your liking and match any outfit!</p>

<p><img alt="04.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/04.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><br />

<p>Check out this big eastern themed stage, complimented with peach blossom flair! This would work perfectly for your next fashion show as a runway. The banners are bright and colorful and certainly have a spring feeling to them.</p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings & salutations everyone,  </p>

<p>Okieeomi here to bring you a special <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/2020/Valentiones_Day/" target="_blank">Valentione's Day event</a> update. I hope you've been able to experience all the exciting activities the event has to offer!  </p>

<p>As we mentioned in our <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/002930.html " target="_blank">previous blog post</a>, this seasonal event was segmented into two phases; the voting phase and the suspenseful result phase.  </p>

<p>During the voting period, adventurers across Eorzea were tasked with listening to the advice each of the protégés offered to lovesick individuals. After which, they were asked to cast a vote on whom they felt most fit to assume the role of emissary of love for this year's festival!  </p>

<p>We had hoped for a fierce clash of blue, red, and yellow, but one individual shone beyond the rest and all <strong><font color="#fb185d">Worlds ended up being dyed red!</font></strong> Astrid received an overwhelming number of votes from her adoring fans, granting her a clear victory!  </p>

<p>The support for Astrid was far greater than we could have ever imagined, but we'd like to thank every single adventurer who cast a vote for their beloved protégés. </p>

<p>But hold onto your gaelicaps, I can hear your fingertips ferociously typing from beyond the rift: <br />
<i>"But Okieeomie... I wanted Rodrigault to win! I wanted to see the town doused in blue!" <br />
"Oh, Okieeomie! I voted for Bert, and I love yellow. Please let me see the yellow décor!"</i> </p>

<p>With a quick /flex and a flick of the wrists, I've taken a peek at what that would've looked like and have brought the images to share with you all! </p>

<p>First off, let's see a World <strong><font color="#19b9f0">doused in blue!</font></strong></p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_01_blue.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_01_blue.jpg" width="630" height="360" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>The beautiful blue cool tones give off the sense of a serene environment. Those that resonated with Rodrigault's advice to meditate and turn towards nature by focusing on themselves would have experienced this option had the votes swayed in his favor. </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_02_blueend1.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_02_blueend1.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>During the quest, adventurers head over to the Conjurers' Guild to meet up with the client.  </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_03_blueend2.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_03_blueend2.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>While thoroughly explaining the situation to Guildmaster E-Sumi-Yan...  </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_04_blueend3.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_04_blueend3.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Sylphie appears! The guildmaster's apprentice proceeds to give us all quite a comprehensive lecture on the importance of personal hygiene and the need for a strong fashion sense. Presumably thwarted by the young girl, Rodrigault reveals it to be all simply part of the plan, and the meditation session was never to be carried out in the first place! Rodrigault admits he would rather set the pendulum in motion and let fate carry out the rest. </p>

<p>I guess you could say Rodrigault really knows how to plan ahead! <br />
 </p>

<p>Moving on, let's see what a World <strong><font color="#f7fb01">dressed in Yellow</font></strong> would've looked like!  </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_05_yellow.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_05_yellow.jpg" width="630" height="360" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>The color theme matches Bert's playful and hot-blooded personality. This is how things would've appeared had the vote been cast in favor at Bert's request to take up woodworking and find true love alongside your own hobbies. </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_06_yellowend1.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_06_yellowend1.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /> </p>

<p>Adventurers meet up with the client at the Carpenters' Guild. He's not overly thrilled to take up the task of woodworking, but Bert eagerly manages to convince him otherwise and the requestor joins the guild.  </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_07_yellowend2.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_07_yellowend2.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /> </p>

<p>Upon entering, we're greeted by the guildmaster, Beatin. Astonished, Beatin asks Bert if he is joking... <br />
Why on earth he would want the Carpenters' Guild to entertain warriors at woodworking?! <br />
 <br />
The client hesitantly tells Beatin he is quite serious about joining the guild and would like to better understand l-o-v-e when...  </p>

<p><a href="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_202014_yn_08_yellowend3.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="EN_202014_yn_08_yellowend3.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_202014_yn_08_yellowend3.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Wait, I'm not sure that's what our client said... </p>

<p><a href="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_202014_yn_09_yellowend4.jpg" target="_blank"><img alt="EN_202014_yn_09_yellowend4.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_202014_yn_09_yellowend4.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Gods forfend, Beatin is at it again! He's deafly misheard our client's word of "love" for "lumber"!  <br />
At the request of Beatin, the client is forced into the forest to meticulously memorize all trees types and their locations found in the Twelveswood!  </p>

<p>"Man, woman, wood...in matters of the heart, I daresay the difference is immaterial," said Bert. </p>

<p>Valentione's Day is ongoing until <font color="#fb185d">Monday, February 17</font>. If you haven't had a chance to obtain the glamour rewards or the new fancy chocolate fountain furnishing items, you still have some time!  </p>

<p>And since we're on the topic of the fountain, it was actually one of the winning entries from the furnishing design contest!  </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_10_chocolatefountain1.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_10_chocolatefountain1.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Here's the cute design that was submitted during the contest~ </p>

<p><img alt="202014_yn_11_chocolatefountain2.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/202014_yn_11_chocolatefountain2.png" width="1280" height="720" class="mt-image-right" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px;" /> </p>

<p>The best part is that you can even dye it to match whatever type of chocolate your heart desires <font color="#fb185d">❤</font>. </p>

<p>Alright then, that's all the ardor and affection we have in store for today! Until we meet again~ </p>

<p>Okieeomi <br />

    	<![CDATA[<p>Hello, this is Voltenyne from the Community Team! </p>

<p>Patch 5.2 arrives on Tuesday, Feb. 18 and will introduce plenty of new content, as well as various improvements and features to the user interface (UI)! Today we'll be taking a quick look at some UI updates before they appear in the patch notes! </p>

<p><font color="skyblue"><strong>■ Waymarks</strong></font><br />
As you may have seen in the latest Letter from the Producer LIVE, new waymarks and features will be added in Patch 5.2. </p>

<p><img alt="20200213_yn_01_marker34.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/20200213_yn_01_marker34.jpg" width="1000" height="625" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>With the addition of "3" and "4", we'll now have a total of 8 waymarks! <br />
(How odd, I could've sworn adding 3 and 4 equals 7...) </p>

<p>We'll also be getting a new feature that saves and loads waymark positions! Waymark positions can be saved as a preset, and from then on you can just load the preset in that duty to place the waymarks with just one click! </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200213_yn_02_preset.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_20200213_yn_02_preset.jpg" width="370" height="545" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>I'm quite certain this will also be used as a shortcut for placing waymarks to spell 3-letter words. </p>

<p><font color="skyblue"><strong>■ Duty Finder</strong></font><br />
The duty commencement window will now display your current Duty Finder settings. </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200213_yn_03_CF.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_20200213_yn_03_CF.jpg" width="569" height="526" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Now it'll be easier to tell when you've accidentally selected Minimum IL when you're trying to solo a dungeon! (shudders) </p>

<p>Additionally, the penalty message displayed when withdrawing from a popped duty will now be shown to all party members and not just the withdrawing player. </p>

<p><font color="skyblue"><strong>■ Reply in Selected Chat Mode</strong></font><br />
Have you ever tried to respond to a joke in FC chat, and accidentally replied in party chat? Or said "Thanks for the party!" in a linkshell when it was meant for your party at the end of the duty? </p>

<p>Whenever I do this, I have to stop and type out an explanation and end up falling behind. Ugh! </p>

<p><img alt="EN_20200213_yn_04_chat.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/EN_20200213_yn_04_chat.jpg" width="600" height="600" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Worry not, "Reply in Selected Chat Mode" may help with that! </p>

<p>Select a message in your chat log and open the subcommand menu, and "Reply to Selected Chat Mode" will be right there! </p>

<p><font color="skyblue"><strong>■ Duty Recorder</strong></font><br />
Duty Recorder can now be used in the following duties: <br />
- The Dying Gasp <br />
- The Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy <br />
- The Copied Factory </p>

<p>After a direct request from Yoshi-P, Duty Recorder will now be capable of recording in alliance raids. Now I can take a good look to see if 2P is guiding me to safety each time! </p>

<p><img alt="20200213_yn_05_yorha.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/20200213_yn_05_yorha.jpg" width="1920" height="1200" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Also, up until now players were forced to leave a completed duty after 10 minutes had elapsed, but starting from Patch 5.2, you'll be able to stay in the duty until the duty timer itself expires! <br />
* If 10 minutes or less remain in the duty, you'll still be removed from the duty in 10 minutes. </p>

<p>The battle against Ruby Weapon, Ocean Fishing, and more will be coming in Patch 5.2 on Tuesday, February 18! Please look forward to it! </p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings, everyone!</p>

<p>Zhexos from the Community team here! Patch 5.2 is around the corner (arriving February 18!), so today I'd like to go over some updates coming to the group pose feature!</p>

<p><font color="gold">* Be sure to click each image to view the full size!</font></p>

<p><strong><font color="skyblue">▼Control Guide has been added</font></strong></p>

<p>While there are many seasoned "gposers" out there, there may be those who are confused by some of the settings and how features within group pose work.</p>

<p>We've added a control guide that will give you a basic overview on what controls to use to improve your screenshot game!</p>

<p><a href="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/na_blog/52gposeen_1.png"><img alt="52gposeen_1t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_1t.jpg" width="600" height="355" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>You'll be able to go from something like this...<br />
<a href="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/na_blog/52gposeen_2.png"><img alt="52gposeen_2t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_2t.jpg" width="600" height="355" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>To this! Yes, yes! (Wait, where did my character go...)</p>

<p><img alt="52gposeen_3.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_3.jpg" width="580" height="602" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /><br />
 <br />
<font color="gold">*The Control Guide will automatically open when you enter Group Pose and can be turned on/off through the menu options.</font></p>

<p>The Control Guide gives you basic controls on:<br />
■ Tilt, Pan, Twisting camera movements<br />
■ Changing the focus target of the camera<br />
■ Disabling motions on a target</p>

<p>Be sure to check out the guide if you're new to the world of taking screen shots or if you're looking to level up your skills!</p>

<p><strong><font color="skyblue">▼Addition of Frames Unaffected by Camera Settings</font></strong><br />
As you may know, we've introduced various frames in the past; however, the size of these frames was affected by your camera's angle of view position. In 5.2 we're adding frames that are unaffected by these camera settings!</p>

<p>Confused? Let me give you some visual examples.</p>

<p><Strong><font color="lime">Frames Added up to Patch 5.1</font></strong><br />
All the previous frames changed the size of the frame based on your camera's angle of view.</p>

<p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_4.jpg"><img alt="52gposeen_4t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_4t.jpg" width="508" height="600" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a><br />
 <br />
Here we can see how the size of the frame is affected between different angle of view settings.</p>

<p>This is useful for some specific types of screenshots, but we've received feedback asking to be able to adjust the angle without affecting the size of the actual frame.</p>

<p>We've got you covered!</p>

<p><Strong><font color="lime">New Frames Added in Patch 5.2</font></strong><br />
We've added new frames that aren't affected by these camera's settings!<br />
And worry not, you can continue to use the existing frames as well!</p>

<p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_5.jpg"><img alt="52gposeen_5t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_5t.jpg" width="508" height="600" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Here we can see how the size of the frame itself is now unaffected, but you're still able to change the angle of view.  </p>

<p><strong><font color="skyblue">▼Frames, Frames, Frames!</font></strong><br />
That's not all, we're also introducing some brand new frames!</p>

<p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_6.png"><img alt="52gposeen_6t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_6t.jpg" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>How about a Journal frame?</p>

<p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_7.png"><img alt="52gposeen_7t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_7t.jpg" width="600" height="355" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Want to turn yourself, your friends, or your favorite minion into an Elite Mark? Now you can do that too!</p>

<p>The frames got buffed in Patch 5.2 so be sure to check them out!</p>

<p><strong><font color="skyblue">▼Feature to Save and Load Camera/Lighting Settings</font></strong><br />
Those of us who have been taking a lot of screenshots with the Group Pose feature will be pleased to hear that you'll now be able to save and load your camera and lighting settings.</p>

<p>Got that perfect angle, zoom, and three point lighting but don't like redoing the settings every time? Or do you, like me, keep forgetting what settings you had it on? This is for you!</p>

<p><img alt="52gposeen_8.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_8.jpg" width="521" height="813" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Once you've got the perfect shot set up, you can now save the camera and lighting settings through the Save Settings menu located on the bottom left of the Group Pose Settings window.</p>

<p><img alt="52gposeen_9.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_9.jpg" width="521" height="813" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Now all you have to do is load the settings and you're ready to shoot!</p>

<p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_10.png"><img alt="52gposeen_10t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_10t.jpg" width="1920" height="1137" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>Now you can set up your perfect shot before hand, jump into Group Pose, load up the settings and take a quick snap!</p>

<p>Here are some screenshots taken by our QA team.</p>

<p><a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_12.jpg"><img alt="52gposeen_12t.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/52gposeen_12t.jpg" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></a></p>

<p>We're excited to see what types of screenshots you all will come up with utilizing these new features! Keep on capturing those great screenshots and be sure to share it with the rest of the community!</p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings wanderers,</p>

<p>Love is in the air and <a href="https://sqex.to/JBwvt">Valentione's day</a> is about to begin! This is my favorite seasonal event...maybe I just really love, love.<font color="#CC0000">❤</font> There is something special about celebrating all those that are closest to you and we make sure there's no shortage of that in Eorzea!</p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_01.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_01.jpg" width="630" height="354" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><br />
<strong><span style="color:orange">Seasonal Event Schedule</span></strong> 　<br />
<strong>Voting Period</strong>: From Wednesday, 29 January at 8:00 to Sunday, 9 February at 14:59 (GMT)<br />
<strong>Results</strong>: From Sunday, 9 February at 15:00 to Monday, 17 February at 14:59 (GMT)</p>

<p>We're shaking things up with this event. This time, all adventurers will see two phases of Valentione's, the voting phase and the result phase, which will vary depending on each of World. Your votes are important, so don't forget to go out and cast your vote! Somehow that rhetoric sounds familiar but I can't quite put my finger on it...hmm...</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">How to Participate</span></strong> <br />
You may begin your love locked quest from Lisette by the Mih Khetto's Amphitheatre (X:10.2 Y:9.4) </p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_02.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_02.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Quest Reward</span></strong> <br />
Check out these oh so endearing five-piece outfits, representing each of our darling protégés! </p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_03.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_03.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>The contrast between each color and the black is really striking, don't you think? <font color="#FFCA28">❤</font> <br />
This time, depending on who you voted for, the name of the item reward and the color will vary. </p>

<p>How could we forget, the most important PSA: no matter your choice, each outfit is dyeable! Be sure to check out the special Valentione website for more details! </p>

<p>Feel free to stay true to your protégé's color or dye it your favorite color! (Personally, I'm a Pastel Pink enthusiast). My favorite part of seasonal event outfits is mix-matching pieces with other gear to come up with unique glamours. We're definitely looking forward to seeing your glamourous screenshots on the forums and social media. </p>

<p>If you'd like to purchase the opposite gender outfit, you'll able to purchase them from the seasonal vendor so be sure to get them while you can! </p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Additional Activities and Rewards</span></strong> <br />
Once you've completed the seasonal quest, you can put the strength of you and your loved one's bond to the test in the Valentione's Ceremony! Upon completion, you'll be rewarded with chocolates that can be traded for an array of delectable items!♪</p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_04.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_04.jpg" width="630" height="360" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Craftily maneuver yourself through this maze with your loved one and see how high you can score! I know the surroundings of fauna and flora are beautiful, but don't let it distract you for too long! If you and your partner start to wander astray too far, your rating will start to trickle down. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work.<br />
 <br />
You can complete the ceremony as many times to your heart's content to receive more chocolates in exchange for said delectable items. Check out this grand chocolate fountain, you can dye the chocolate to the flavor you desire! White chocolate, matcha, strawberry, the possibilities are endless!</p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_05.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_05.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>As part of the delicious dessert set, it also features an assortment of fruits and sweets! Can't decide which one I'd like to start from, but chocolate dipped strawberries are certainly a classic. (drool)</p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_06.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_06.jpg" width="630" height="360" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>I'm sure this chocolate fountain will bring a big smile to you and your friends, so enjoy decorating your house with it and satiate that sweet tooth of yours!♪</p>

<p><img alt="20200124_sk_07.jpg" src="https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20200124_sk_07.jpg" width="630" height="360" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>And with that, we hope you enjoy this year's festivities. I just wanted you all to know, I'm kupo nuts for you.<font color="#1565c0">❤</font> Happy Valentione's Day!</p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings and salutations, adventurers! How are you enjoying this year's Starlight Celebration? I hope you and your chocobo are keeping cozy in its new Saintly Barding as the year winds down. Be sure to enjoy the Starlight festivities until the end of the year!</p>

<p>But as we all know, the end of the Starlight Celebration also means the start of a new year, and that also means.... Heavensturn begins!</p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_1.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_1.png" width="600" height="337" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Event Period</span></strong> <br />
31 December 2019 at 15:00 through 14 January, 2020 at 14:59 (GMT)</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">How to Participate</span></strong> <br />
To begin you can speak with the Nezumi Bugyo at Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks (X:11.5 Y:13.9) to accept the quest.</p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_2.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_2.png" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Quest Details</span></strong> <br />
Heavensturn marks the beginning of a new twelve moons to come. In Eorzea, we celebrate a sacred festival where one among the Twelve wins celestial favor. Coincidently, the far east also has a similar celebration where one beast is selected and honored by forging a helm in its likeness.</p>

<p>The Nezumi Bugyo and his mouse companions attempt to popularize the festive food, advent cakes. However, it seems that mice are disliked by the people of Eorzea...</p>

<p>Gather information from the people of Limsa Lominsa to succeed in spreading advent cakes.</p>

<p>Speaking of rats in Limsa Lominsa, a certain beast tribe comes to mind!</p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_3.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_3.png" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">New FATE</span></strong> <br />
A new FATE related to the Nezumi Bugyo's advent cakes will be available!</p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_4.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_4.png" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:orange">Event Rewards</span></strong> </p>

<p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Head Armor:</span> Crimson Nezumi Kabuto / Cobalt Nezumi Kabuto </p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_5.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_5.png" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>This Heavensturn it's a rat-themed kabuto- quite fitting for this year! Look how you can even see its cute front teeth captured perfectly! </p>

<p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Furnishing:</span> Heavensturn Bounty </p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_6.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_6.png" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>If you fancy sprucing up your home for the new year, there's this adorable nezumi furnishing piece. Isn't the little rat at the top precious?</p>

<p><span style="color: #00ccff;">Magicked Prism (Advent Cakes)</span></p>

<p><img alt="20191227_ye_7.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191227_ye_7.png" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Finally, for those who may want to celebrate the new year in a more traditional Japanese style, these magicked prisms go off with a bang by displaying the iconic kagami mochi decoration midair.</p>

<p>What an amazing firework to have when reflecting on your fondest memories with your friends this Heavensturn! (Psstt! I've heard it's wonderful when used in /gpose!)</p>

<p>Just as 2019 is nearing its end, so too has this blog. I sincerely hope that with not one but two seasonal events back-to-back, your time spent in Eorzea this holiday season will be forever memorable as we close out the teens and enter this new decade together ♥</p>

<p>If you haven't already, be sure to check out the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/2020/Heavensturn/">event site</a>! Please look forward to Heavensturn!</p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone! I'm sure some of you are currently running around the lush landscapes of Onsal Hakair, charging to the next ovoo to try and claim it as your own. Keep those reflexes sharp because the next season of the feast will be starting in Patch 5.18! </p>

<p><img alt="20191220_sm_01_feast.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191220_sm_01_feast.jpg" width="600" height="157" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>As mentioned by Producer & Director Yoshida in the latest Letter from the Producer LIVE, we received lots of feedback requesting the next season of The Feast to be released soon, so we've decided to release it ahead of schedule! </p>

<p>However, as we were unable to prepare certain rewards in time, please keep in mind that the Wolf Collars, previously awarded to the Top 10 and as ranking tier rewards, will not be obtainable. </p>

<p>Rest assured, the other ranking rewards and titles are still available as usual! </p>

<p>I'd like to showcase the reward that will be given to the Top 100 ranking players at the end of the season. Take a look! </p>

<p><img alt="20191220_sm_02_feast.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191220_sm_02_feast.jpg" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Vroom, vroom! Well it'll certainly be hard to miss you riding around in one of these! It certainly looks fearsome and compliments some of the previous armor awards well. </p>

<p>As always, there's also an exclusive trophy that will be awarded to the top ranking player of each data center. Give it your all and aim for the top of the rankings! </p>

<p><img alt="20191220_sm_03_feast.jpg" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191220_sm_03_feast.jpg" width="600" height="338" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>PvP actions saw significant change in Shadowbringers so we're very excited to see what strategies arise and how gameplay evolves. There are also additional adjustments coming to PvP actions and Onsal Hakair in Patch 5.18, so please have a look at the patch notes when they are available. After you've spent some time out in the fray, we'd love to hear your feedback on the PvP forums! </p>

<p>And with that, I'll see you next time, on the battlefield! <br />

<p>The album features: <br />
・ 8 tracks presented in full-orchestra arrangement, available in both 2.0ch and 5.0ch (Near ver. / Far ver.) audio. For reference, near: as heard from the conductor's position and far: as heard from the seats at the rear of the concert hall. <br />
・ Video footage of all 19 songs from the September 23rd FINAL FANTASY XIV Orchestra Concert 2019 -Eorzean Symphony- performance (Encore included!) </p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #00ccff;">Included first-run bonuses</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>An in-game item code for</strong>:<br />
Tsukuyomi's Pain (Orchestral Version) Orchestrion Roll <br />

<p>This album contains arranged versions of in-game tracks from A Realm Reborn, Heavensward, and Stormblood that were performed at the FINAL FANTASY XIV Orchestra Concert 2019 -Eorzean Symphony-! </p>

<p>You can also find commentary by Yoshi-P and Soken on the disc!  </p>

<p>According to Soken, the 5.0ch Far ver. is "like listening from the heavens." Give it a listen and perhaps you too will ascend! </p>

<p>Finally, we have bonus stickers for the first 800 customers! Get them now while they last! </p>

<p>We turned the Eorzean Symphony 2019 key art into these special moogle stickers, which have a certain "plumpness" to them! If you'd like these adhesive moogles to stick with you, be sure to order early! </p>

<p><img alt="20191211-yn-02.png" src="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/pr/blog/blog_image/20191211-yn-02.png" width="600" height="339" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>While this isn't part of the album, here's some backstage footage from the orchestra concert. It's not every day we get to see what goes on behind the scenes, so it's worth a look! </p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings Warriors of Light (or Darkness)! Kiwikopo reporting in with some details on what went down at last week's Fan Gathering in London!</p>

<p><img alt="London_FG014b.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG014b-thumb-400xauto-11312.jpg" width="400" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>We visited the <a href="https://www.postalmuseum.org/">Mail Rail at the Postal Museum</a> with about 200 adventurers, many of whom were there for the first time. </p>

<p><img alt="London_FG015.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG015-thumb-400xauto-11290.jpg" width="400" height="189" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="London_FG020.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG020-thumb-300x400-11288.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>We also had a surprise guest, who was none other than our Producer and Director Yoshi-P himself!</p>

<p><img alt="London_FG001.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG001-thumb-300x400-11286.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Of course, we had to have him do the honours of drawing the raffle winners. We had a lot of prizes to give away on the night, including a signed Shadowbringers PlayStation 4!</p>

<p><img alt="London_FG004.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG004-thumb-300x400-11292.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><i>Please do not step on him... literally...</i></p>

<p><img alt="London_FG011.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG011-thumb-300x400-11297.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>To wrap it up, we had a Free Company Shoutout session where everyone took turns in going on stage and delivering speeches dedicated to their free companies or friends. We had some pretty memorable (and enthusiastic) ones and were super happy to see some familiar faces!</p>

<p><img alt="London_FG019.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG019-thumb-300x400-11299.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p><img alt="London_FG018.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG018-thumb-300x400-11301.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Our old friend, the la-HEE Serpent of Ronka, also returned as a special guest (in plushie form)!</p>

<p><img alt="London_FG017.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG017-thumb-300x400-11303.png" width="300" height="400" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Aside from the activities above, we had a mini-train available so our adventurers could journey through the tunnels of Amh Araeng - I mean the historical postal railway of London!</p>

<p><img alt="London_FG021.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/London_FG021-thumb-400xauto-11310.jpg" width="400" height="299" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<p>Once again, a huge thank you to everyone for coming to the Fan Gathering and to <a href="https://www.postalmuseum.org/">the Postal Museum</a> for hosting us. I hope you all had as much fun as we did, and we can't wait to see you again at the next event!</p>

<p><img alt="IMG_20191120_204107.jpg" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/assets_c/2019/11/IMG_20191120_204107-thumb-400xauto-11308.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

    	<![CDATA[<p>Greetings, weary wanderers!</p>

<p>Thanks to the minstreling wanderer's penchant for embellishment, adventurers can now relive their thrilling showdown against Hades in the Minstrel's Ballad: Hades's Elegy! Those who have faced Hades before may be intimately familiar with <span style="font-style:oblique;color:#c675de;">Invincible</span>, the theme that plays during the second portion of the fight (especially if you've failed some DPS checks along the way...). Today, we're delighted to share the <span style="font-style:oblique;color:#c675de;">Invincible</span> lyrics with you! </p>

<p>Coincidently, just as <span style="font-style:oblique;color:#c675de;">Invincible</span> was the final theme for Hades, it was also played as the finale during the orchestra concert held during September in Japan. </p>

<p>Now here comes my favorite Easter egg! Listening to the in-game version of the song, players may notice that the lyrics are a bit difficult to understand. That is due to the fact that the song was composed as if the Ancients were chanting the theme in their native language! However, because the song was going to be performed during a live concert, actual lyrics were created for it! </p>

<p><img alt="20191101_rr_01.png" src="https://img.finalfantasyxiv.com/lds/blog_image/eu_blog/20191101_rr_01.png" width="1920" height="1080" class="mt-image-center" style="text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 20px;" /></p>

<center>
<hr style="border-top: 3px dotted #c675de;">
<span style="font-size:x-large;font-weight:bolder;font-style:oblique;color:#d550fc;text-decoration:underline;text-shadow: 2px 2px #5c029e;">Invincible</span><font color="#c675de">

<p>Lasciate</p>

<p>Ogne speranza</p>

<p>These memories ache with the weight of fate</p>

<p>Ever we fight</p>

<p>Never we fly</p>

<p>Ever we fall</p>

<p>Forever we fall</p>

<p>Now breathe deep of the darkness beneath the flood</p>

<p>Where all of the proud angels drink to their deeds of blood</p>

<p>Their lies, twisted and torn, into dreams they're spun</p>

<p>Yet ever we still stand tall</p>

<p>Invincible</p>

<p>Never we fall<br />
<hr style="border-bottom: 3px dotted #c675de;"></font></center><br />
<span style="font-size:normal;">We hope that knowing the lyrics will help convey and capture the very essence of emotions that flowed throughout this tragic tale of a man and a battle that ne'er shall be forgotten!</span><br />
